## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

1. **Open Arduino IDE**
2. **Add ESP8266 Board Manager URL**:  
   Go to `File > Preferences`, and add this URL to the "Additional Board Manager URLs":
    http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
3. **Select Board**:  
- `Tools > Board > NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)`

4. **Upload Code**:  
- Copy and paste the code from this repository into your Arduino IDE.
- Click **Upload**.

5. **Connect to Robotâ€™s WiFi Network**:  
- Look for a network named `Project wifi car`.
- Connect via mobile or browser to the robot's IP (usually `192.168.4.1`).

6. **Control Your Robot**:
- Use the web interface to move the robot.
- Use **Google Voice Commands** like:
  - "Move forward"
  - "Turn left"
  - "Stop"
  - "Turn on light"

## ðŸ§  Code Overview

The code handles:

- **Motor direction & speed control** via GPIO pins
- **WiFi Access Point setup** with ESP8266WebServer
- **Command parsing** for:
- Movement (F, B, L, R, etc.)
- Speed adjustment (0â€“9)
- Light ON/OFF (W/w)
- Stop command (S)

Commands are received through a web server and mapped to robot actions in real-time.
